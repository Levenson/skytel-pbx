** xmlrpc-handlers
Provide rpc requests to the station. Its a front end of the Station
throught you can send commands and monitoring events. It should be
started with limited user rights.

** validator
List of check- functions for easy argument validation that sends to
xmlrpc-handlers, and tasks by taskmanager.

** taskmanager
Back end system with root-like rights which will do tasks builded by
xmlrpc-handler.


* How it works

Schema is look something like this:

System starts with hunchentoot ( lisp web-server ) daemon and enables
xmlrpc-handlers. Daemon runs by htoot user and it have no right to
harm you system. When request comes, xmlrpc-handler will check
received arguments through the validator, build a task and save it for
the taskmanager.

Taskmanager is a lisp script which starts every N minutes by cron
system. It reads tasks, again check arguments by validator and perfome
the actions.
